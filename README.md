# Templar

Templar is the filesystem-aware wrapper for Temple text processor.

It is meant to be a default template processor engine for Kasha PHP framework, but it can be used standalone, too.

##Â Installation

Install Temple with Composer by adding a requirement into composer.json of your project:

```json
{
   "require": {
        "barcodex/templar": "*"
   }
}
```

or requiring it from the command line:

```bash
composer require barcodex/templar:*
```
